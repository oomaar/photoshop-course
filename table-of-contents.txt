   Hi As a temp workaround try selecting these options in preferences and restarting PS, you won't get the Home Screen but it might enable you to work with Photoshop, 
   I never use the Home Screen, but just tested in Windows 10 with Photoshop 20.0.2 and it's working fine for me Deselect "Auto show the Home Screen" and enable 
   "Use Legacy "New Document" Interface".
